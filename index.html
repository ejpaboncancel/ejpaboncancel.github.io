              Universities Research Association-Sandia Graduate Student Summer Fellowship
            </a>, where I worked on data-driven machine learning surrogate models 
            (data-driven closure models) and data assimilation. 
            
            I am a former research intern at the 2023 MIT Lincoln Laboratory
            Summer Research Program, where I worked on unsupervised machine learning under
            Group 39 of Division 3, as part of the

            Puerto Rico at Ponce REU Program in Algebraic Coding Theory,
            Probability and Combinatorics, where I researched
            algebraic-geometric error-correcting codes and linear
            error-correcting codes under Prof. Fernando Piñero from the 
            University of Puerto Rico at Ponce. 
            <br>
